We are the first one to study Multi-Consistency Correspondences based on the learning method (previous work based handcrafted methods). In this paper, we propose three innovatives: such as Correspondence Data Augmentation, Motion Consistency Encoding, and Multi-Scale Local Feature Aggregation Block to process Multi-Consistency Correspondences issue.
