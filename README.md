This code is our core model. We will upload Correspondence Data Augmentation, training, testing code, and dataset after acceptance.

We are the **first** one to study Multi-Consistency Correspondences based on the deep learning (previous work based handcrafted methods). In this paper, we propose **three innovations**: such as Correspondence Data Augmentation, Motion Consistency Encoding, and Multi-Scale Local Feature Aggregation Block to process Multi-Consistency Correspondences issue.
